Dude, just watched Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness, and man, it’s like my brain’s been through a blender. 😂 So many feels, you know what I mean? One minute you’re all “aww,” and the next you’re like, “what am I even watching?” That old guy though, gotta love his grumpy wisdom shtick. But seriously, do people get wiser when they get older, or just more cryptic? 

> Anyway, the lighting in the movie was...interesting, I guess? Like, I’m an electrician, right? So I’m sitting there going, “Did they intentionally put those shadows there, or was that just a happy little accident?” 😂 Either way, it kinda worked. Makes me wanna download the movie just to pause on those scenes and analyze them. Or maybe I’m just overthinking it. 

And can we talk about the dialogue? Sometimes it’s like they sat down and thought, “How do we make everything sound like a mix of a fortune cookie and a soap opera?” But hey, it’s what makes the movie unforgettable, right? I was half expecting someone to pop out and say, “Tune in next week for more philosophical debates by candlelight.” 

Speaking of lights, why is it that whenever there’s a power outage in movies, nobody ever seems to have a flashlight on hand? Like, be prepared, people! I can’t watch a movie like that without thinking, “Obviously, these folks don’t know their basic household electrical safety.” 😅

function doNothing() { return; } // honestly, no clue why I thought of this

Oh, and the soundtrack... did it remind you of elevator music on some kind of emotion-enhancing steroids? Mix in some melancholic piano, and bam – instant tearjerker. Anyway, maybe I’m just tired. Lemme know if you watch the movie, though. Curious to see if it scrambled your thoughts just as much! 😊
